A tour of the massive collection of things I think you should know about in formal methods.

Here's what I plan to cover
1. Famous paradoxes, totality, computability, intro to logics, GÃ¶del, Church, and Turing,
2. Type Theory. Building up to CiC (Calculus of Inductive Constructions) from untyped lambda calculus,
3. A deservedly long tour of proof assistants: Coq, Isabelle, Idris, Agda, Lean,
4. A quick tour of model checking and SMT solvers,
5. A quick tour in the recent efforts in formal verification.
6. A real treatment of verifying something system level. Rust and Separation logic likely involved.
7. A real treatment of verifying something cryptography. Algebra involved, Cryptol + Saw likely involved.
8. A real treatment of verifying something hardware. SystemVerilog likely involved.

The earlier writings focuses on the "why"s: Why do want dependent types? Why do we have so many proof assistants?
The later writings start to zoom-in on the "how"s.

I hope that when you see this, I have a few crisp chapters done. But it will be a long journey for me. 
Out of the eight sections I planned, I am only confident in writing about the first two with my current knowledge.
But, this is my profession, so I get the chance to sit in it all day, and I will sure slay the beast.
