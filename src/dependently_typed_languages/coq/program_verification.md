# Program Verification

We finished `Imp.v` knowing:
1. We can write fixpoints (total functions) for `aeval` and `beval`,
2. However, `ceval` can not be a fixpoint, since 
there is no way of totally unfolding a while expression.
3. The solution is to write `ceval` as a relation (not even a function).
In Coq, this means to make `ceval`'s result a `Prop`, which is allowed
to not terminate.

`Prop`s can be thought of in many ways:
1. In the lens of decidability, `Prop` is a vaguer `Bool`: If the `Prop`
at hand happens to be decidable, then it acts just like a `Bool`. However,
`Prop` is also allowed to be undecidable,
2. In the lens of constructability, `Prop` throws away its witnesses.
Consequently, given `Definition fooable B P := exists b : B, P b.`, a `Prop`,
we won't be able to `destruct` on it and obtain the `b` used. For this scenario,
we would need a dependent pair, which is a `Type`: `Definition fooable P := {b : B | P b}.`
3. In the lens of extractability. `Prop`s get erased during Coq extraction.

Since `ceval` is not a fixpoint, the property that two cprograms are the same
becomes not so obvious. We need this: Two commands are behaviorally equivalent
if, for any starting state, they either both diverge and they both terminate in the
same final state.

```coq
Definition cequiv (c1 c2 : com) : Prop :=
  forall (st st' : state),
    (st =[ c1 ]=> st') <-> (st =[ c2 ]=> st').
```

Implications capture the divergence possibility. Since, a divergent program `c` 
has the precise property of
```coq
forall (st st' : state),
  ~ (st =[ c ]=> st')å
```

We can now prove behavioral equivalences between different programs. Here is one such interesting 
equivalence:
```coq
Theorem loop_unrolling : forall b c,
  cequiv
    <{ while b do c end }>
    <{ if b then c ; while b do c end else skip end }>.
```

Now, `cequiv` is a mathematical equivalence (it is straightforward to show reflexivity, 
symmetry, and transtivity). However, it is not so obvious that behavioral equivalence
is a congruence.

Recall, congruence is an equivalence relation on a set $S$. But importantly, 
it must be constructed against some operation $*$ between elements of $S$.

Your equivalence relation $\sim$ is congruent if for all $s_1 \sim s_2$
and $t_1 \sim t_2$, you have $s_1 * t_1 \sim s_2 * t_2$. The `cequiv`
congruence (yet to be proven) is a relation on the set of all programs 
and $*$ are the compositional constructors.


Congruence is desirable, since this tells us that the equivalences of two subprograms implies
the equivalence of the larger programs in which they are embedded. For example,
```
              cequiv c1 c1'
              cequiv c2 c2'
         --------------------------
         cequiv (c1;c2) (c1';c2')
```
This showcases just one embedding: The embedding of smaller programs into a larger sequence program.

There are five constructors that builds larger programs out of smaller ones: `E_Seq`, `E_WhileTrue`, `E_WhileFalse`,
`E_IfTrue` and `E_IfFalse`. We need to show congruence for each of these separately.

TODO: Though `ceval` is a relation, it is a partial function! But what if we add non-determinism to it?
